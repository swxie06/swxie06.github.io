I am Siwen Xie (解思文), a junior student at [Yuanpei College, Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/), majoring in AI with a dual degree in psychology. I am also a member of Tong Class, a special program for AGI founded by [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/).

My research interest lies especially in Cognitive Reasoning that involves social interaction, such as intention inference and Theory of Mind.

Besides my academic pursuits, I enjoy literature, anime and table role-playing games.
