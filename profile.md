Hello! My name is **Siwen Xie (解思文)**, and you can call me **Lucy**!

I am a senior undergraduate at [Yuanpei College, Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/), member of the Tong Class (a special program for Artificial General Intelligence founded by [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/)). I major in Artificial Intelligence  with a double major in Psychology. 

My research interest lies in computational cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience, specifically in the fields of planning, decision making, and social cognition.

In my free time, I enjoy:

- Reading and writing fiction
- Making cool videos about ACGN and my life
- Playing Table-Top RPG with friends
